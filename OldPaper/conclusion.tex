\section{Conclusion}
We suggest an initialization heuristic for $k$-means obtained by a suitable modification of  the sampling based algorithm of Jaiswal \etal~\cite{jks}.
Sampling based algorithms, apart from being simple, have the advantage the they are inherently parallel.
We give a parallel implementation of our algorithm.
We do a comparative analysis on large real and synthetic datasets comparing our results with the state-of-art algorithms.
Our experiments show notable cost and running time benefits.
We would like to recommend our algorithm as an alternative for the \kmpp\ algorithm as an initialization algorithm on any standard multicore platform since our algorithm exploits the available parallelism easily and efficiently to give very good quality solutions.
