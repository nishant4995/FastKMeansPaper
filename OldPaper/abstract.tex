We provide a fast data-parallel initialization routine for $k$-means algorithm. 
The algorithm is based on sampling techniques that are easy to implement and parallelize. 
These parallel algorithms are implemented on a dual-socket Intel\textregistered Xeon\textregistered E5-2680v2. 
Empirical evaluations on large real and synthetic datasets demonstrates the practical utility of our techniques.
